# Ticketing System

This is a ticketing system that will allow companies to sign up, then user and agents to register under the company's ID. From there they will be able to submit tickets, and agents can work on them. I used React TypeScript on the front end, Flask and Postgres. It is still a work in progress, as I did not have my laptop for over a week. Most of what you see was done the night before it was do, and was acomplished from an all nighter. There is no styling, and the ticketing aspect doesn't work. The only way to create a ticket is through PostMan, and even then it is iffy.
